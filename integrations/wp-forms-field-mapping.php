// The problem with WPForms forms in this regard is that it generates field names that aren't always easy for our plugin to recognize. 
// You will have to inspect the source of the form to find field names (name="...") for each field and manually map them as such:

add_filter( 'mc4wp_integration_wpforms_subscriber_data', function( MC4WP_MailChimp_Subscriber $subscriber ) {
	$subscriber->merge_fields[ "FNAME" ] = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['wpforms[fields][7][first]'] );
	$subscriber->merge_fields[ "COUNTRY" ] = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['wpforms[fields][7][country]'] );
	return $subscriber;
});
